								My main research concerns the understanding and mitigation of stellar activity. Under
								the supervision of Dr. Xavier Dumusque, I am part of the project ''Signal
								COrrection to Reveal other Earths'' (SCORE) funded by the European Research Council
								(ERC).
							</p>
							<h3>Sun-as-a-star observations and their quality control</h3>
							<p align="justify">
								The HARPS and HARPS-N instruments have obtained continuous, high S/N, high precision
								radial velocities (RVs) of the Sun. However, without simultaneous meteorological
								monitoring, these observations will occasionally be influenced by clouds and, in the
								case of HARPS-N located in La Palma, dust winds from the Sahara called calima. These
								weather phenomena introduce one-sided outliers in the linear relation expected between
								the apparent magnitude of the Sun and its airmass, known as the extinction, as it
								traverses the sky. The extinction slope is also of importance to correct the RVs from
								differential extinction due to the tilt of the Sun's rotation axis relative to the
								horizon normal, causing a flux inbalance between the red- and blueshifted hemispheres.
							</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">
								As a consequence of the non-gaussian nature of the noise, the method of least-square
								fitting becomes biased and insufficient. Instead, I perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo
								(MCMC) analysis to simultaneously model a fore- and background population by exploring
								the parameter space. Marginalizing over the likelihoods allows for the definition of
								quality flags on each individual measurement, which are readily available on the ''Data
								& Analysis Center for Exoplanets'' (DACE) platform.
							</p>
							<h3>Radial velocities based on the formation temperature of spectral lines</h3>
							<p align="justify">
								Convection in the envelopes of low-mass stars create surface granulation patterns
								consisting of ascending hot granules and descending cool intergranular lanes. Light
								emitted from these different regions will contain spectral lines with varying strengths
								(due to the difference in intensity) and Doppler shifts (due to the convective motion).
								For unresolved sources, i.e. most stars, the disk-averaged spectral lines will be
								asymmetrical and have a net blueshift with respect to the stellar restframe.
							</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">
								Spectral lines formed at different depths will also be differently affected by the
								convection, known as the third signature of granulation. In previous efforts to mitigate
								the impact of stellar activity on RV measurements, several studies have investigated the
								dependency on a line-by-line (LBL) basis. It has been found that some lines are more
								strongly correlated with activity signals, and that the signal amplitude decreases as a
								function of line depth when averaging over certain depth intervals.
							</p>
							<p align="justify" style="text-indent: 5%">
								In my work, I explore a new approach in calculating LBL RVs based on the average
								formation temperature, obtained from spectral synthesis, of sampled points across
								individual line profiles. RVs are then computed and averaged on segments of lines
								divided by binning the range of formation temperatures. By doing so, the aim is to
								disentangle activity signals originating at different layers, corresponding to different
								temperatures, of the stellar atmosphere.
